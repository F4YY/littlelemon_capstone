                        Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes
                        served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of
                        12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices,
                        making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.
                        Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared
                        dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy.
                        Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to 
                        incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
